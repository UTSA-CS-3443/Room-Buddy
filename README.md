# Pitch & Description
There is no amazing roommate matching application on the market today. We want people to build real connections with each other before moving in together. The goal is to create harmonious living environments in the best way possible!  

Our app will allow for apartment hunters to find the perfect roommate through surveys which gauge interests and hobbies. It will serve as a tool for users to meet beforehand rather than after a lease is signed.


# Known Issues
-Assumes unique full name for every user
-No acronym at all (when entering in university, major, classification, etc.)
-Potential bug: Must finish profile creation after signing up
-No commas in user bio
